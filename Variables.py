# variables in python - way to store data within a program
# > it becomes a reference for that data
# a variables can change
# variable_name = variable_data

a = 1 # int
b = 2
c = 3.5 # float
hi = "my name is kevin!" # string

# print(a+b)
# dynamically typed language - Python
# more user-friendly and teachable language and efficient


# in java
# int a = 1;
# in java must determine data type and when you are ending using;

# comment on multiple line cntrl/
# type method

#print(type(a))

# variables can be overwritten as it runs linear

# d = 5
# # print(d)

# d = 7
# print(d)

# user input

# print("what is you name?")

# concatenation task

# age = 29
# print("what is your name and age")

# print("my name is and age")
# print("kevin" + ' ' + str(age)) #here i have added the str function to overide python to think that the age is a string
